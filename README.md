# Data-Preprocessing-for-COVID-19-Dataset
Description:
This script is designed to preprocess a COVID-19 dataset in preparation for further analysis or modeling. The script performs the following key tasks:
Library Imports: It imports essential libraries for data manipulation, numerical computations, and visualization (numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas).

Dataset Import: It reads the dataset from an Excel file (Covid_Data_new.xlsx) using pandas. The independent variables (features) and dependent variable (target) are separated into X and Y respectively.

Handling Missing Data: It uses the SimpleImputer class from sklearn.impute to handle missing data by replacing NaN values with the mean of the corresponding columns. This step is crucial for maintaining the # # integrity of the dataset and ensuring that machine learning models can be trained without errors due to missing values.

The script includes print statements to display the intermediate results of X and Y after loading the dataset and after handling missing values in specified columns.
